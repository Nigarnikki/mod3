			<h3>Dolma</h3>
			<p>The term dolma covers a variety of stuffed vegetable dishes, widespread in the Caucasus, Middle East and Mediterranean area. Dolma of grape (vine) leaves or yarpag dolmasi are one of the most popular forms of dolma. Dolma in Azerbaijani Turkish means – “filled with” or “stuffed”. In this dish grape leaves will be stuffed by mince.150 g vine leaves.Dolma is the traditional recipe of stuffed vegetables. You can find some similar dishes in many other countries. And yet, Azerbaijani recipe has its own peculiarities. Common vegetables to fill dolma include tomato, pepper and aubergine. Moreover, dishes of vine or cabbage leaves wrapped around a filling are also called dolma. For stuffing Azerbaijanis use mixture of minces meat, rise, flavoured with mint, fennel and other local herbs. Sometimes dolma is cooked in earthenware, which gives an additional scent to the dish.Dolmas are the staple in Azerbaijan cuisine. To me, they remind me of the typical Lebanese stuffed vine leaves but in Azerbaijan they can also be made with cabbage or come in the form of stuffed vegetables like tomatoes, aubergines or peppers, so dolmas are as basically “stuffed vegetables”.When they are stuffed with meat, dolmas are served warm and when they are stuffed with rice they are served cold, like in the Middle East. Originally, stuffed vegetables were enjoyed in Ancient Greece and called fyllas. Today’s word, dolma, comes from the Turkish for stuffing.<a id="back2Top" title="Back to top" href="#">Back to top</a>

                <h3>Plov</h3>
                <p>It is a classic dish of rice and meat, sometimes flavoured with herbs and condiments. Similar dishes are common in many European, Asian and even African cuisines. But Azerbaijani pilaf is different. The three main components of local pilaf are riсe covered with saffron, cinnamon and aromatic herbs; fried mutton, chicken, lamb or beef; and mixture of vegetables, greens and sometimes even dried fruits and chestnuts. However every household and restaurant has its very own variation of pilaf recipe in Azerbaijan which have just one common feature: all of them are super delicious.Pilaf, or rice, is one of the most typical Azeri dishes. It resembles Indian Biryani or Moroccan spiced rice which often comes with dried fruits and nuts. And this is precisely the best part of Azeri pilaf, the touches of spices and dried fruits which give it an exotic and sweetish flavour.Expect to enjoy it with saffron and cinnamon plus lots of dried fruits like apricot or even dates and chestnuts. Rice will usually be served with meat, most commonly mutton or lamb which are the favourite combinations. You can also get chicken with it.The most revered of the rice dishes is Shakh Plov or King Pilaf which is a very unique recipe where the rice is encased in a round crust made with layers of crispy lavash, the thin tortilla style bread that usually accompanies the kebabs. When served, the cake is cut into four pieces so the rice inside is revealed to the guests in what is quite a spectacle.<a id="back2Top" title="Back to top" href="#">Back to top</a> </p>

                <h3>Kebab</h3>              
                <p>Similar meat dishes are also very popular in a great region stretched from Middle East to Eastern Europe and South-East Asia. Azerbaijan has many types of kabab and shashlik. It is made from different kinds of marinated chopped or minced meat, chicken or fish, and vegetables, such as bell pepper, onion, mushroom and tomato. All this is pinned on a skewer and is fried over fire like a barbecue. However the taste is very different. When it is prepared, kabab is often served with lavas (slim sheets of unleavened bread), union and greens.The omnipresent typically Turkish and Middle Eastern dish is perhaps the most common item in Azeri menus and it originated from the traditional way Azeris used to hunt for meat and thread it into metal skewers to grill it over fire, so it is authentic Azerbaijan traditional food.Kebab purely stands for “fried meat” or barbecued in Arabic and it can include meats, fish or vegetables, or combinations of them properly marinated and spiced. When we think of kebab we usually think of skewers but kebabs can also simply refer to barbecued food served on a plate.Traditionally, kebabs on skewers are called shishlik for the shish or metal skewer in which they are served. The word was introduced in the Russian language. The most common kebab is made of lamb and the differences between most kebab types lies in the marinade. <a id="back2Top" title="Back to top" href="#">Back to top</a>
